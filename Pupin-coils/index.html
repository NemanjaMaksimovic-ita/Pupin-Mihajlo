<p>Pupin's <ins>1899</ins> patent for loading coils, archaically called "<b>Pupin coils</b>", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <b>Oliver Heaviside</b>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. <br>The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <b>American Telephone & Telegraph</b> (<i>AT&T</i>), making him wealthy. Although <b>AT&T</b> bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <b>George Campbell</b> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
